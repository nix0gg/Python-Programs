This repository consists of python programs which show the following in action:
    ‚öôÔ∏è Logic
    üîß User defined functions
    üß∞ Built in functions & features
    ‚è≠Ô∏è Indentation

The idea of this repository is to give you a brief introduction to Python and make it easier to understand.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Things to keep in mind:

1. Not all information provided in this README file is accurate, which is why I highly encourage you to fact-check certain aspects of this file. Don't rely on this file only, instead, learn from multiple sources.

2. This repository is subject to changes and somethings may be added or removed.

üîß How to write and run python programs:

If you want to run and write python programs, you'll need to install and IDE for python (Recommened for beginners: IDLE).

You can download this repository as a zip file and extract the files from the zip file, then execute the programs from the extracted folder. You can even modify the code to your liking. (Be careful as you could break the code if you make a mistake. 

Luckily, you can undo the changes and fix the code, provided that you haven't saved the broken code and reopened it again.)

In this case, we'll be using IDLE.



There are two modes in IDLE IDE:

1. Interactive Mode:

    In this mode, you'll see a Window which shows ">>" at the left side. You can type lines of code like "print(1+1)" and upon entering, it shows you the output.

2. Script Mode:

    In this mode, you can write python programs fully and execute all the lines of code at once, unlike Interactive Mode.



üß† Learning about Python:

Python is an object-oriented high level programming language.

‚öôÔ∏èFeatures of Python:

- **Easy to read and write:** 
    Python's syntax is simple and looks like English, so it's great for beginners.

- **No need to declare variable types:** 
    You can just write `x = 5` and Python figures out the type for you.

- **Interpreted language:** 
    You don't need to compile your code; just run it and see the results.

- **Works everywhere:** 
    Python runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, and more. (It is platform independent.)

- **Lots of built-in tools:** 

    Python comes with many modules and libraries to help you do things like math, web development, and data analysis.

- **Supports different styles:** 

    You can write code using objects, functions, or just simple scripts.

- **Big community:** 

    There are lots of tutorials, forums, and help available online.

- **Free and open-source:** 

    Anyone can use Python for free and even help improve it.

- **Automatic memory management:** 

    Python cleans up unused data for you, so you don't have to worry about it.
